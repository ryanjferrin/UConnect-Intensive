    "  - Work through the Datasets and Questions lesson from [ud-120](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) within the Jupyter Notebook environment\n",
    "  - Introduce [the `pickle` module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html) from the Python Standard Library for preserving data structures in Python\n",
    "  - Practice loading data from different directories\n",
    "  - Review stacking and unstacking in `pandas` to [reshape a `DataFrame`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reshaping.html)\n",
    "  - Explore and understand data sets, particularly those with many missing values\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "  - You should be familiar with `pandas` (lesson 1 in the [UConnect-Intensive repo](https://github.com/ryanjferrin/UConnect-Intensive))"
