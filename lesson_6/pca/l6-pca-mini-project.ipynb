    "## Objectives\n",
    "  - Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a large set of features to explain as much of the variance as possible in the data using a smaller set of features (reducing the dimensionality).\n",
    "  - Introduce the `class_weight` parameter for `SVC()`, to see how correctly predicting targets from a smaller class size can be weighted more heavily.\n",
    "  - Visualize the eigenfaces (orthonormal basis of components) that result from PCA.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "  - You should have the following python packages installed:\n",
    "    - [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/index.html)\n",
    "    - [numpy](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html)\n",
    "    - [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)\n",
    "  - For context, you should also have watched Sebastian & Katie's Udacity video lectures on PCA prior to working through this notebook.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Acknowledgements\n",
    "  - The content of this notebook builds on the code from [pca/eigenfaces.py](https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects/blob/master/pca/eigenfaces.py) from the [**ud120-projects**](https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects) repo, and derives from [an eigenfaces/SVM example in the sklearn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/face_recognition.html)\n",

    "\n",
    "Our discussion of PCA spent a lot of time on theoretical issues, so in this mini-project we’ll ask you to play around with some sklearn code. The eigenfaces code is interesting and rich enough to serve as the testbed for this entire mini-project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The starter code can be found in pca/eigenfaces.py. This was mostly taken from the example found here, on the sklearn documentation.\n",
    "Take note when running the code, that there are changes in one of the parameters for the SVC function called on line 94 of pca/eigenfaces.py. For the 'class_weight' parameter, the argument string \"auto\" is a valid value for sklearn version 0.16 and prior, but will be depreciated by 0.19. If you are running sklearn version 0.17 or later, the expected argument string should be \"balanced\". If you get an error or warning when running pca/eigenfaces.py, make sure that you have the correct argument on line 98 that matches your installed version of sklearn."
